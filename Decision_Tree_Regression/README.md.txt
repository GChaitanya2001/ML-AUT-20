The zip file consists of a .ipynb file and a report detailing the procedure and results.

Run .ipynb file on any python platform, preferably GOOGLE COLAB.

Install the libraries mentioned(if not installed) on top of .ipynb file
 
Instructions for installing libraries:

* Use: 
       pip install /libraryname/

* The program takes longer time,due to large amount of given data(43K).

* if you want faster results to check whether all parts are running, decrease the dataset
 size by adding the following line to main function before part1:
                            
        df = df[:/size/]
